    <p>We are an activist collective working to prevent climate change in Boston, and are not affiliated with private interests.</p>
    <p>The City of Boston has the authority to decide where our energy comes from. City residents can come together and, with the power of bulk purchasing, choose to buy more renewable electricity without increasing costs to businesses and residents.</p>
    <p>Learn more in the short infographic video below!</p>
map_summary: |
  <p>Dozens of towns across Massachusetts and hundreds across America
  are choosing how they get their energy instead of depending on the
  utility to choose for them.<p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
  <p><strong>Brookline, MA</strong> recently initiated a plan to increase
  their renewable commitment by <strong>25%</strong> of their power usage.
  <strong>Greenfield, MA</strong> went for a <strong>100%</strong> renewables plan in December 2016.</p>
  <p>This is a plan that is working for lots of communities - let's make it work for Boston!</p>

        <p>With bulk purchasing, we can obtain <strong>5% more renewable
        energy</strong> without increasing energy costs. This will save
        tonnes of CO2 each year, protecting the environment and helping
        us reach our climate targets.</p>

        <p>The new Community Choice Energy purchasing plan <strong>will
        not add overall costs to residents or businesses</strong>. The
        new shared plan will also protect us from price spikes caused by
        the changing cost of fossil fuels.</p>

        <p>Have people been calling you or knocking on your door and
        offering you a new electricity plan? Many of these plans do not
        deliver on their promises. Our Community Choice Energy plan
        protects residents against energy scams by implementing a new
        citywide clean energy electricity plan for all of us.</p>

faqs:
    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>Yes!</strong> No one is locked into the Community Choice
        Aggregation plan, and you may opt out of the plan to keep the
        Eversource defaults orwhatever energy buying program you choose.</p>
    - question: 'Will this affect the utility companies'' margins?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Eversource earns its money on the transmission
        and delivery only, not on the power generation, so utility jobs
        should not be affected.</p>
    - question: 'Will buying more solar cause brownouts on cloudy days?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>No.</strong> The grid is able to sustain a much higher
        percentage of renewable sources than it currently delivers.  We could
        reasonably double the amount of solar currently powering our grid
        without running into trouble.</p>

petition_body: |
    <p>We petition the elected officials of the city of Boston -
    Mayor Marty Walsh and the City Council - to formally engage an
    energy broker to find contracts to purchase energy generation
    for the City of Boston that increases our renewable commitment
    by at least 5% over the required Renewable Portfolio Standard
    state levels.</p>
    <p>We believe it is critical to take this action to mitigate the
    effects of climate change to protect the environment and future
    generations.  Adaptation and resilience is not sufficient - by
    engaging in bulk renewable purchasing, we can help drive the
    market toward clean energy solutions for the betterment of
    Boston, America, and the world.</p>
