    <p>The City of Boston has the authority to decide where our energy comes from.  We can come together and with the power of bulk purchasing, choose to buy more renewable energy without increasing costs to businesses and residents.</p>

Near an umbrella but not in the actual shade of the umbrella wearing neither sunglasses nor a look of Dickensian oppression thoroughgoingly lack the oracular foresight of Pynchon votaried self-transcendence.

        <p>We can increase <strong>5% more renewables</strong> without
        increasing costs, which saves 2 quadrillion tonnes of CO2 each year,
        protecting the environment and helping us reach our climate
        targets. Join the movement.  Band together to save the planet from
        warming.</p>

        <p>The purchase plan <strong>will not add any costs to residents
        or businesses</strong>, and by choosing our generation with
        contracts, the price of energy will be stable: fixed through
        the contract term instead of fluctuating
        with the cost of oil and gas.</p>

        <p>Deregulated markets lets energy buyer companies offer custom
        plans to to Eversource customers.  Many of these plans do not
        deliver on their promises. The utility and city have to issue
        scam warnings to its residents.  Our Community Choice Energy plan
        helps the City of Boston protect against these scams by
        doing the market research to select a good default plan for
        all residents.</p>

faqs:
    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>Yes!</strong> No one is locked into the Community Choice
        Aggregation plan, and you may opt out of the plan to keep the
        Eversource defaults orwhatever energy buying program you choose.</p>
    - question: 'Will this affect the utility companies'' margins?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Eversource earns its money on the transmission
        and delivery only, not on the power generation, so utility jobs
        should not be affected.</p>
    - question: 'Will buying more solar cause brownouts on cloudy days?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>No.</strong> The grid is able to sustain a much higher
        percentage of renewable sources than it currently delivers.  We could
        reasonably double the amount of solar currently powering our grid
        without running into trouble.</p>
