        The law lays out a process for the City of Boston to choose to power
        our city as a whole with renewable energy resources such as solar and
        wind. Community choice energy is the fastest way that Boston can get
        on the path to being a 100% renewable energy city.

        that will fall disproportionately on vulnerable communities.

        "We whole-heartedly endorse the Community Choice Energy (CCE) initiative
        in Boston.  Using the power of bulk puchasing in the electricity generation
        market, CCE consolidates demand by Boston residents for locally generated
        wind, solar and non-fossil fuel electricity."
