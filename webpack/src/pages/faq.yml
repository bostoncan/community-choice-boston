    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>Yes!</strong> No one is locked into the Community Choice
        Aggregation plan, and you may opt out of the plan to keep the
        Eversource defaults orwhatever energy buying program you choose.</p>
    - question: 'Will this affect the utility companies'' margins?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>No.</strong> Eversource earns its money on the transmission
        and delivery only, not on the power generation, so utility jobs
        should not be affected.</p>
    - question: 'Will buying more solar cause brownouts on cloudy days?'
      answer: |
        <p><strong>No.</strong> The grid is able to sustain a much higher
        percentage of renewable sources than it currently delivers.  We could
        reasonably double the amount of solar currently powering our grid
        without running into trouble.</p>
