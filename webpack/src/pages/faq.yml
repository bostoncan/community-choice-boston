faqs:
    - question: 'What is Community Choice Energy?'
      answer: |
        Massachusetts state law allows any city or town to choose the electricity
        supplier for all its residents and businesses. This way, we can make
        important energy decisions instead of for-profit utilities and their
        competitors.
    - question: 'Will I pay more?'
      answer: 'Our goal is to get you 5 - 10% more renewable energy with little
        or no raise in cost. In the longer term, our goal is to create a path
        for 100% of Bostonians'' energy to be renewable, without raising costs
        significantly for residents.'
    - question: 'Will this stabilize my electric bill?'
      answer: |
        Yes. The electric utilities change their prices every six months and
        we’ve seen some big price spikes, especially in winter. Community Choice
        Energy will give us a longer-term contract with electricity suppliers.
    - question: 'Will it clean up the air?'
      answer: |
        Yes. More renewable energy means less air pollution coming from power
        plants fueled with gas, oil, and diesel -- and so less smog and asthma.
    - question: 'Will it help fight climate change?'
      answer: |
        Yes. Community Choice Energy is the fastest single way of reaching
        Boston’s greenhouse gas reduction goals.
    - question: 'Who will be my electric company?'
      answer: |
        Eversource will still deliver your electricity and send you bills.
        Community Choice Energy only changes the generators – the power plants,
        windmills, and solar arrays that produce your electricity.
    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        Yes! No one is locked into the Community Choice Energy plan. If you
        currently have a competitive supplier you can keep that supplier as
        long as you like. If you have Eversource as your supplier, you can opt
        out of Community Choice Energy or choose another competitive supplier.
    - question: 'How does Community Choice Energy work?'
      answer: |
        Once the City Council passes a Community Choice Energy ordinance, the
        City chooses an energy broker, a company that buys energy on the
        wholesale market. The broker prepares a proposal that buys more
        renewable power without little or no cost to us customers. If the City
        likes the plan, it can accept the plan. Or it can reject the plan at
        no cost to the City or us.
    - question: 'Is this the same as Community Choice Aggregation?'
      answer: 'Yes. It’s also known as municipal aggregation.'
    - question: 'Is anyone else doing this?'
      answer: |
        The oldest and largest municipal aggregation project in Massachusetts
        is the Cape Light Compact, which buys electricity and runs energy
        efficiency programs for all the towns on Cape Cod plus Martha''s
        Vineyard. Melrose, Dedham, Brookline, Somerville, Cambridge, Arlington,
        Gloucester and many other towns have also approved municipal
        aggregation.
    - question: 'Will this create more solar and wind power in New England?'
      answer: |
        Yes. Class I renewable energy generators have to be located in New
        England. Buying power from them supplies the money they need to finance
        new projects. Our renewable energy purchases will shift the whole
        regional grid away from fossil fuels.
    - question: 'Isn’t my utility already buying green energy?'
      answer: |
        Yes. The Massachusetts Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requires
        utilities to buy 12% of their energy from qualifying "Class I
        renewables" in 2017, plus another 1% per year after that. By 2020 we
        will reach 15% and by 2050 utilities will have to get about 45% of their
        energy through renewable resources. Sounds great, but it’s too slow to
        meet the challenge we face from climate change. With Community Choice
        Energy, Boston can jump years ahead of state law and send policymakers
        a message that the state’s RPS is too slow.
    - question: 'Will this affect the utility companies'' profit margins?'
      answer: |
        No. Eversource earns its money on the transmission and delivery only, not on the power generation, so utility jobs should not be affected.
    - question: 'Will buying more solar cause brownouts on cloudy days?'
      answer: |
        No. The grid is able to sustain a much higher percentage of renewable
        sources than it currently delivers. We could reasonably double the
        amount of solar currently powering our grid without running into trouble.
