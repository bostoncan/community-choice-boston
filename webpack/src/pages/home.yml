    <p>The City of Boston has the authority to decide where our energy comes from.
    By passing a city ordinance, we can come together and, with the power of bulk
    purchasing, choose to buy more renewable electricity without increasing costs
    to businesses and residents.</p>

  <p>Dozens of towns across Massachusetts and hundreds across America
  are choosing how they get their energy instead of depending on the
  utility to choose for them.<p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
  <p><strong>Brookline, MA</strong> recently initiated a plan to increase
  their renewable commitment by <strong>25%</strong> of their power usage.
  <strong>Greenfield, MA</strong> went for a <strong>100%</strong> renewables plan in December 2016.</p>
  <p>This is a plan that is working for lots of communities - let''s make it work for Boston!</p>

        <p>With bulk purchasing, we can obtain <strong>5 - 10% more renewable
        energy</strong> without significantly increasing energy costs. This
        will save tonnes of CO2 each year, protecting the environment and
        helping us reach our climate targets. </p>

        <p>Have people been calling you or knocking on your door and offering
        you a new electricity plan? Many of these plans do not deliver on their
        promises. Our Community Choice Energy plan protects residents against
        energy scams by implementing a new citywide clean energy electricity
        plan for all of us.</p>

faqs:
    - question: 'What is Community Choice Energy?'
      answer: |
        Massachusetts state law allows any city or town to choose the
        electricity supplier for all its residents and businesses. This way,
        we can make important energy decisions instead of for-profit utilities
        and their competitors.
    - question: 'Will I pay more?'
      answer: 'Our goal is to get you 5 - 10% more renewable energy with little or
        no raise in cost. In the longer term, our goal is to create a path for
        100% of Bostonians'' energy to be renewable, without raising costs
        significantly for residents.'
    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        Yes! No one is locked into the Community Choice Energy plan. If you
        currently have a competitive supplier you can keep that supplier as
        long as you like. If you have Eversource as your supplier, you can opt
        out of Community Choice Energy or choose another competitive supplier.

    <p>We petition Mayor Marty Walsh and the Boston City Council to increase
    renewable energy and stabilize our electric bills by purchasing electricity
    for Boston residents and small businesses.</p>
    <p>Climate change makes this action urgent. By bulk-purchasing renewable
    power, we can help drive the market for clean energy and protect Boston,
    the United States, and the world.</p>
