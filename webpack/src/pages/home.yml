    <p>We are an activist collective working to prevent climate change in Boston, and are not affiliated with private interests.</p>
    <p>The City of Boston has the authority to decide where our energy comes from. By passing a city ordinance, we can come together and, with the power of bulk purchasing, choose to buy more renewable electricity without increasing costs to businesses and residents.</p>

  <p>Dozens of towns across Massachusetts and hundreds across America
  are choosing how they get their energy instead of depending on the
  utility to choose for them.<p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
  <p><strong>Brookline, MA</strong> recently initiated a plan to increase
  their renewable commitment by <strong>25%</strong> of their power usage.
  <strong>Greenfield, MA</strong> went for a <strong>100%</strong> renewables plan in December 2016.</p>
  <p>This is a plan that is working for lots of communities - let''s make it work for Boston!</p>

        <p>With bulk purchasing, we can obtain <strong>5% more renewable
        energy</strong> without increasing energy costs. This will save
        tonnes of CO2 each year, protecting the environment and helping
        us reach our climate targets.</p>

        <p>Have people been calling you or knocking on your door and
        offering you a new electricity plan? Many of these plans do not
        deliver on their promises. Our Community Choice Energy plan
        protects residents against energy scams by implementing a new
        citywide clean energy electricity plan for all of us.</p>

        "The law lays out a process for the City of Boston to choose to power our city as a whole with renewable energy resources such as solar and wind. Community choice energy is the fastest way that Boston can get on the path to being a 100% renewable energy city."

faqs:
    - question: 'What is Community Choice Energy?'
      answer: |
        Massachusetts state law allows any city or town to choose the
        electricity supplier for all its residents and businesses. This way,
        we can make important energy decisions instead of for-profit utilities
        and their competitors.
    - question: 'Will I pay more?'
      answer: |
        No. Our goal is to get you at least 5% more renewable energy without
        raising the overall cost. In future years, maybe we can get
        7% renewables, 10%, and eventually 100%!
    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        Yes! No one is locked into the Community Choice Energy plan. If you
        currently have a competitive supplier you can keep that supplier as
        long as you like. If you have Eversource as your supplier, you can
        opt out of Community Choice Energy or choose another competitive
        supplier.

    <p><strong>Dear Boston City Councilors and Mayor Walsh</strong>:<br/>
    We want to stabilize our energy prices, clean up Boston’s air, cut the
    city’s carbon emissions, and speed up the transition to renewable power.
    Please approve a Community Choice Energy ordinance for Boston electric
    customers.</p>
    <p>We believe it is critical to take this action to protect Bostonians
    today, future generations, our city and our environment. With bulk
    purchasing of renewable energy, we can help drive the market toward clean
    energy solutions for Boston, America, and the world.</p>
