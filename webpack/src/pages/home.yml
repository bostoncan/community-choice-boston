    <p>The City of Boston has the authority to decide where our energy comes
    from. Our City Council has authorized the Mayor to use the power of bulk
    purchasing to add more renewable electricity to the default supply provided
    by Eversource, without increasing costs to businesses and residents. This
    is called “Community Choice Energy” or “Green Municipal Aggregation.”</p>
    <p>Learn more in the short infographic video below!</p>
    <p>The campaign for Community Choice Energy has been led by a coalition
    convened by Boston Climate Action Network, a volunteer-led group of city
    residents committed to climate justice and  organizing to broaden the
    constituency for a green economy and frame climate concerns to resonate
    with Boston residents’ daily lives.</p>

  <p>Dozens of towns across Massachusetts and hundreds across America
  are choosing how they get their energy instead of depending on the
  utility to choose for them.<p>
  <ul class="list-unstyled">
  <p><strong>Brookline, MA</strong> recently initiated a plan to increase
  their renewable commitment by <strong>25%</strong> of their power usage.
  <strong>Greenfield, MA</strong> went for a <strong>100%</strong> renewables plan in December 2016.</p>
  <p>This is a plan that is working for lots of communities - let's make it work for Boston!</p>

        <p>With bulk purchasing, we can obtain <strong>5 - 10% more renewable
        energy</strong> without significantly increasing energy costs. This
        will save tonnes of CO2 each year, protecting the environment and
        helping us reach our climate targets. </p>

        <p>Have people been calling you or knocking on your door and offering
        you a new electricity plan? Many of these plans do not deliver on their
        promises. Our Community Choice Energy plan protects residents against
        energy scams by implementing a new citywide clean energy electricity
        plan for all of us.</p>

              The law lays out a process for the City of Boston to choose to power
              our city as a whole with renewable energy resources such as solar and
              wind. Community choice energy is the fastest way that Boston can get
              on the path to being a 100% renewable energy city.

faqs:
    - question: 'What is Community Choice Energy?'
      answer: |
        Massachusetts state law allows any city or town to choose the
        electricity supplier for all its residents and businesses. This way,
        we can make important energy decisions instead of for-profit utilities
        and their competitors.
    - question: 'Will I pay more?'
      answer: 'Our goal is to get you 5 - 10% more renewable energy with little or
        no raise in cost. In the longer term, our goal is to create a path for
        100% of Bostonians'' energy to be renewable, without raising costs
        significantly for residents.'
    - question: 'Will I be able to keep my current plan?'
      answer: |
        Yes! No one is locked into the Community Choice Energy plan. If you
        currently have a competitive supplier you can keep that supplier as
        long as you like. If you have Eversource as your supplier, you can opt
        out of Community Choice Energy or choose another competitive supplier.
    - question: 'What would community choice energy do for environmental justice?'
      answer: |
        In Massachusetts, poor communities bear the brunt of fossil fuel
        pollution and get few of its economic benefits. White and affluent
        homeowners can install solar panels or buy renewable energy, but poor
        communities have a much harder time getting solar power and cutting
        their electric bills. Meanwhile, poor communities suffer the worst
        impacts from air pollution, high summer heat without air conditioning,
        and public transit disruptions due to severe weather.

    <p>We petition Mayor Marty Walsh to increase renewable energy and stabilize
    our electric bills by promptly implementing Community Choice Energy</p>
    <p>Climate change makes this action urgent. By bulk-purchasing renewable
    power, we can help drive the market for clean energy and protect Boston,
    the United States, and the world.</p>
